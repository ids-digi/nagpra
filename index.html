                <p class="dropcap">In 2000, the IU anthropology department hired its first full-time Native American
                    professor, Wesley
                    Thomas. His office was in the Student Building, where, unknown to him at the time, thousands of
                    Indigenous human remains were stored in the basement.</p>
                <p>The ancestral remains had been accumulated over decades by the IU anthropology department, removed
                    from their resting place in the name of science. They were used for research that the majority of
                    Native Americans consider offensive and inhumane, including racial classification studies.</p>

            <div class="story">
                <p>When he realized the human remains were in the Student Building a few years later, Wesley said he
                    asked the anthropology department chair to move his office to a different building.</p>
                <p>“I was extremely disturbed by it,” Wesley said. “Something that people outside of a Native community
                    do not understand is that we're aware of our ancestors and their presence. My office got to the
                    point where I couldn't concentrate or focus, and I had to move out.”</p>
                <p>Wesley’s request to move was quickly fulfilled. But he said he still didn’t feel comfortable teaching
                    at IU, where according to interviews with him and other faculty, the majority of the anthropology
                    department didn’t view Indigenous perspectives as legitimate through the early 2000s. Instead, they
                    adhered to “old school” teachings of the field which cast Native American people as objects of
                    scientific study rather than people with human rights.</p>
                <p>In 1990, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act mandated that federally funded
                    institutions, including IU, start working to return their collections of Native American human
                    remains and cultural items to Tribes through a process called repatriation, which typically ends in
                    reburial. But none of the human remains at IU were repatriated until 24 years after this law passed,
                    and eight years after Wesley had left the university.</p>
                <div class="definition-card wide-right">
                    <p class="word">NAGPRA <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i></p>
                    <p class="definition">Law passed in 1990 which mandates federal agencies and museums that receive
                        federal funds to repatriate or transfer ownership of human remains, funerary objects, sacred
                        objects and objects of cultural patrimony to lineal descendants, federally recognized tribes,
                        and Native Hawaiian organization.
                    </p>
                    <p class="source"><strong>SOURCE:</strong> <a href="https://www.blm.gov/NAGPRA">Bureau of Land
                            Management</a></p>
                </div>
                <p>Slow responses to NAGPRA were not unusual, especially in the years right after the law passed, when
                    there was little guidance on best practices for both institutions and Tribal Nations. As of 2005,
                    only about 40% of institutions had reported completing at least one repatriation, according to
                    public data.</p>
                <p>But in interviews with the Indiana Daily Student, current and former faculty alleged that IU avoided
                    complying with NAGPRA in good faith for years. Administrators pushed the sensitive, difficult task
                    of starting the repatriation process onto anthropology faculty with full-time research and teaching
                    responsibilities who didn’t sign up for NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>The inventory of human remains IU was required to report in 1995 classified the vast majority as
                    “culturally unidentifiable,” leaning on a loophole in the law which allowed institutions to avoid
                    repatriation and continue research. Despite faculty advocacy as early as the late 1990s, IU didn’t
                    provide funding for NAGPRA work until 2013 — three years after the federal law was updated to close
                    the loophole.</p>
                <p>In that year, IU hired Jayne-Leigh Thomas — not related to Wesley Thomas — who still serves as the
                    director of the IU NAGPRA Office. In the 10 years since, Jayne-Leigh has greatly improved the
                    university’s reputation for NAGPRA compliance, according to interviews with faculty. Jayne-Leigh has
                    led the department as it built up a staff of five other full-time employees, formed meaningful
                    relationships with Tribal representatives, completed multiple large repatriations and helped at
                    least five other universities build up similar programs.</p>
                <p>The story of NAGPRA at IU, which garnered media attention recently after a January ProPublica
                    investigation of repatriation efforts across the country, is one of great complexity. Faced with the
                    problematic legacy of how IU acquired its vast collection of human remains to begin with, IU
                    employees and Tribal members agree the process of NAGPRA today can never fully right the wrongs of
                    the past. But it can help everyone involved move forward.</p>

                <p>Wesley Thomas said when he worked at IU in the early 2000s, NAGPRA was already a core concept taught
                    in anthropology classes. But he described it as a “hush” topic among faculty, along with other
                    Indigenous issues.</p>
                <p>Wesley is a member of the Navajo Nation, and he was the only full-time Native American faculty member
                    in the department during his time as an assistant professor at IU from 2000 to 2006. During those
                    years, he recalled other faculty members often changing the subject away from Indigenous topics as
                    soon as he walked in the room.</p>
                <p>“If I start[ed] asking questions, that would upset the whole department and the university,” said
                    Wesley, who is also the founding director of the IU First Nations Educational & Cultural Center.</p>
                <p>He said the culture of the department contributed to his decision to leave IU and return to the
                    Navajo Nation in 2006, where he is now a professor emeritus at Navajo Technical University.</p>
                <p>“I felt extremely awkward, uncomfortable, unpleasant, that I shouldn't be there,” Wesley said. “I
                    think it was probably one of the reasons why I decided to leave. I knew it was not a place where
                    Indigenous people should be there as faculty members, because the university was not ready for it.”

                <p>While most faculty members at the time were unaware or uninterested in NAGPRA, according to multiple
                    interviews, a small number of professors were pushing for better compliance efforts starting in the
                    late 1990s. The same year Wesley started at IU, Richard Wilk became the department chair of the
                    anthropology department, and said he was concerned about what he described as IU’s noncompliance
                    with the spirit of the law.</p>

                <p>In 1990, NAGPRA set a 1995 deadline for institutions to compile an inventory of all the human remains
                    in their possession. The goal was to determine how many human remains and cultural items each
                    institution had amassed and understand which materials were associated with which Tribal nations
                    based on evidence — an important step to enable repatriation work.</p>

                <p>To meet the 1995 inventory deadline, IU administrators saddled one associate professor, Della Collins
                    Cook, with the responsibility of cataloging thousands of human remains and cultural items, on top of
                    her regular teaching and research responsibilities. Cook was hired as an associate professor and the
                    curator of the collection of human remains and cultural items, did not have past experience with
                    repatriation work, and IU provided no NAGPRA training or overtime pay to help her complete the
                    inventory.</p>
                <p>Cook declined to comment on her experiences for this story.</p>

                <p>IU did not provide adequate resources or staffing to help Cook complete the NAGPRA inventory or work
                    on other NAGPRA compliance, said Anne Pyburn, IU Provost Professor of Anthropology who has worked at
                    IU-Bloomington since the ‘90s. Pyburn, who is also married to Wilk, said asking a professor to add
                    NAGPRA work to their job was unreasonable.</p>
                <p>“That's a different skill set,” Pyburn said. “It's not just, ‘Here's another full time job,’ it's
                    ‘Here's another full time job that you don't know how to do.’”</p>

                <p>Based on the original law, institutions — not Tribes — had final say on whether human remains were
                    associated, or “culturally affiliated,” with Tribal Nations. Because of this, some institutions
                    leaned on a loophole which allowed them to mark remains as “culturally unidentifiable” even if there
                    was evidence otherwise, essentially absolving them of legal responsibility to halt research and
                    begin repatriation work.</p>
                <p>In IU’s original inventories, from both the Department of Anthropology and the Glenn Black Laboratory
                    of Archaeology, nearly all of the combined 5,800 reported human remains were marked culturally
                    unidentifiable. Students and faculty, including Cook, continued to research the ancestral remains
                    for decades after the inventory was submitted, according to faculty interviews. Research only
                    officially fully stopped as of 2021, when IU established a NAGPRA research review board.</p>
                <p>“You could basically get away with saying that everything's unaffiliated and we don't have to do
                    anything about it, especially when you think about how much it would cost and the time and the
                    effort required,” Wilk said.</p>
                <p>Wilk, who is now a professor emeritus, said he raised concerns about the anthropology department’s
                    inventory with the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the time, Kumble Subbaswamy, alerting
                    him about IU’s potential noncompliance with NAGPRA.</p>
                <p>Wilk said Subbaswamy dismissed his concerns, citing financial constraints.</p>
                <p>Subbaswamy, now the Chancellor at UMass Amherst, did not respond to emails from the IDS requesting
                    comment about this exchange.</p>
                <p>Wilk also wrote letters to and called the National NAGPRA office, hoping an official notice of
                    noncompliance would push IU administrators to act. But the office was busy, and didn’t have the
                    resources to investigate the truthfulness of IU’s reported inventory. As long as the university
                    continued to claim the majority of its collection was culturally unaffiliated, it was technically
                    following the letter of the original law.</p>
                <p>Wilk also reached out to the dean of the Maurer School of Law, Alfred Aman Jr., seeking clarification
                    on the details of NAGPRA to confirm IU wasn’t in legal trouble. But he didn’t hear back from him
                    either.</p>
                <p>Aman, now a professor emeritus, told the IDS he does not remember Wilk reaching out since it was more
                    than 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>“I think rather than active opposition, what we got was lack of movement,” Wilk said. “There's a
                    difference between actively opposing something and just not dealing with it. And I think that's what
                    we were doing for a long time, was just not dealing with it.”</p>
                <p>This avoidance wasn’t surprising given the culture of the department. Most of the faculty in the
                    early 2000s had been educated during a period in the field of anthropology when Native American
                    remains were considered valuable objects of scientific study, not a human rights issue, Wilk said.
                </p>
                <p>“Some of the older archeologists and the bio-anthropologists felt that NAGPRA was not a good thing
                    for their science,” Wilk said. “They didn't like having the bones taken away by Tribes who just
                    wanted to bury what they considered to be extremely valuable data that they had been wanting to
                    study, and keep studying.”</p>
                <p>Anne Pyburn said another reason anthropologists across the country didn’t respond well to NAGPRA was
                    because they had long defined respect differently than the Native Americans whose ancestral remains
                    they studied.</p>
                <p>“From many — not all, but many — Indigenous perspectives, the kind of scientific study that
                    archaeologists have done on their ancestors is disrespectful, but archaeologists are not doing that
                    to be disrespectful,” Pyburn said. “The archaeologists who do it are, from their cultural
                    perspective, extremely respectful, and in fact have devoted their lives to understanding these
                    ancestral peoples. I think that's why when NAGPRA was passed, archaeologists were hurt that so many
                    Indigenous people accused us of colonialist disrespect.”</p>

                <p>IU originally reported more than 5,800 Native American human remains in both the Department of
                    Anthropology and the Glenn Black Lab, making its collection one of the largest of a federally funded
                    institution in the country.</p>
                <p>Over decades, philanthropist Eli Lilly, the grandson of the founder of Eli Lilly and Company,
                    coordinated and funded most of the projects that ultimately brought thousands of Native American
                    human remains and cultural items to IU. He funded both the IU Department of Anthropology in 1947 and
                    the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology in 1965.</p>
                <p>Starting in the 1930s, Lilly became fascinated with archaeology, and made use of his extensive
                    financial resources to sponsor archaeologists and graduate students to study the prehistory of
                    Indiana, according to his biography, resulting in excavations and acquisitions of human remains.</p>
                <p>He sponsored Glenn A. Black, who became the first full-time archaeologist in Indiana, covering his
                    field expenses and arranging for him to study at the Ohio State Museum. Black and Lilly became close
                    friends, according to Lilly’s biography.</p>

                <p>Around the same time, Lilly began a decades-long obsession with the Walam Olum, a set of birch bark
                    scrolls supposedly found and transcribed from the Lenape, or Delaware, language into English in
                    1833, which most historians now agree was probably forged.</p>
                <p>Lilly sponsored several more anthropologists over the years, both to build scholarship on Indiana
                    archaeology in general, and as part of his plan to prove the Walam Olum’s validity with a
                    multidisciplinary research team. In the mid-1930s, Lilly provided fellowships to linguistic
                    anthropologist Charles F. Voegelin, archaeologist James B. Griffin, and physical anthropologist
                    Georg K. Neumann, who specialized in the study of skeletal remains.</p>
                <p>Neumann had a particular interest in skulls, and studied at least 10,000 of them during his career.
                    Sometimes he would visit other museums to examine their materials, but often he would receive
                    donated skeletal remains that would then remain at IU permanently.</p>

                <p>Neumann was one of the leading physical anthropologists studying Native American remains at the time,
                    and he sought to classify human remains from different Tribal groups into racial categories,
                    according to an analysis of his work by IU professor Della Collins Cook, who was hired as his
                    replacement in the 1970s. His research is today categorized as racial classification, a
                    pseudoscientific theory that was often used to try to find genetic differences between human races,
                    a concept used to scientifically reinforce racial hierarchies. Neumann practiced phrenology, the
                    study of the shape and measurements of skulls, which is now considered pseudoscience.</p>
                <p>Neumann’s career built on the work of scientists like Samuel Morton, a phrenologist who classified
                    humans into five different races and who associated skull size with intelligence and racial
                    superiority, and whose work was used to justify chattel slavery.</p>

                <p>Neumann, Black, Voegelin, Griffin and a few others became known as the “Indiana group,” according to
                    the biography. Lilly planned to combine research from the work of his Indiana group into a
                    definitive manuscript, which he hoped could prove the story of the Walam Olum.</p>
                <p>Lilly’s interest in the Walam Olum was rooted in his desire to link the Lenape, or Delaware, Tribe
                    with ancient settlements in Indiana, where large burial mounds like the ones at the Angel Mounds
                    site in Vanderburgh County were built.</p>
                <p>Since it first surfaced in 1833, the Walam Olum has repeatedly been used by researchers to justify
                    personal beliefs or political agendas with Native history.</p>
                <p>The scientist who claimed to have found the original copy of the Walam Olum in 1833 was sympathetic
                    to the Native American cause, according to historian Andrew Newman. His discovery came three years
                    after the brutal Indian Removal Act of 1830, when at least 18 Tribes were forced to relocate west of
                    the Mississippi River, including most of the Tribal Nations in Indiana. Given this historical
                    context, Rafinesque likely had a political motivation to publish the Walam Olum because it claimed
                    the Lenape people migrated from the Old World, and he hoped to generate sympathy for Native people
                    by linking their genetic and cultural heritage to Europeans.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Walam Olum has also been used to provide evidence for the existence of a
                    fabled “race” of “Moundbuilders,” a myth from the early 20th century, said Grimm. The myth claims
                    that the ancient people who built burial mounds had to have been more advanced, and more directly
                    related to Europeans, than the Native Tribes that still live in America.</p>
                <p>“That is false,” Grimm said. That's a fallacy, that was a racist myth.”</p>
                <p>Regardless of Rafinesque’s motivations, his approach delegitimized Indigenous perspectives,
                    discounting Lenape oral history and implying that Native Americans must fit into traditional Western
                    ideas of advanced civilizations to deserve respect, according to Grimm and Newman’s research.</p>
                <p>As early as 1932, Lilly was discouraged by contemporaries from pursuing Walam Olum research. In one
                    letter quoted in Lilly’s biography, anthropologist Carl Guthe wrote that “the Walam Olum thesis is a
                    rather frail reed on which to lean in archaeological work.” But Lilly and his Indiana group
                    continued to work on the thesis for 20 years, working on the project while also pursuing other
                    research.</p>

                <p>In 1938, Lilly provided $68,000 (more than $1.4 million today) to help the Indiana Historical Society
                    purchase the Angel Mounds site in Vanderburgh County, and Black began to excavate. Materials from
                    Angel Mounds form the largest portion of IU’s archaeological collection today, comprising more than
                    2.5 million artifacts, including pot sherds, ceramics, stones, animal bones and shells. Black and
                    others also excavated hundreds of human remains there.</p>
                <p>The continued research of the rest of the Indiana group also brought Native American remains from
                    dozens of U.S. states to IU through donations from other museums, universities or private donors,
                    some of the main ways anthropologists acquired research materials through the 20th century.</p>

                <p>Partnering with Indiana University was a logical next step for Lilly, who needed an institution to
                    house artifacts and continue to produce research as part of his long-term goal of ensuring a future
                    for anthropology work in Indiana. By mid-1947, Lilly had worked with then-Chancellor Herman B Wells
                    to establish the IU Department of Archaeology, instating Black, Voegelin and Neumann as the core
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>A few years later, Lilly finally achieved his goal of publishing a manuscript on the Walam Olum,
                    titled “Walam Olum or Red Score: The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians.” The
                    book received mixed reviews, as anthropologists recognized the impressive scope of the project, but
                    also pointed out the limitations of relying on the Walam Olum as a primary document.</p>
                <p>Black continued to excavate Angel Mounds, where he lived for most of his life, until his sudden death
                    in 1964. At that time, Lilly funded the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology at IU, both to
                    honor his friend and to provide a place to store and facilitate the research of the millions of
                    artifacts and hundreds of human remains that could no longer be stored at Angel Mounds.</p>
                <p>The methods used to acquire Native American remains for study and the nature of that resulting
                    research is seen as extremely offensive by most Native American Tribes today.</p>
                <p>Carrie Wilson, NAGPRA Director at the Quapaw Nation, said she can’t understand why past scientists
                    felt the need to excavate human remains and cultural items.</p>
                <p>“As far as trying to understand the logic behind it and all that kind of stuff, I can't even begin to
                    go there,” she said. “I don't know. But anyway, there's lots of human remains out there, and they
                    still have to be reburied.”</p>

                <p class="section-break">•••</p>

                <p>In the early 1990s, Wilson received a letter from the Glenn Black Lab at IU notifying her that IU had
                    human remains and cultural objects likely affiliated with the Quapaw. Because of a combination of
                    factors, those remains wouldn’t be repatriated until decades later.</p>
                <p>“There wasn't any email in 1995,” said Jayne-Leigh Thomas, director of the IU NAGPRA Office. “What
                    was happening across the country is that the tribes were being inundated by stacks and stacks and
                    stacks of those written letters, and not necessarily having an office that was dedicated to handling
                    all that.”</p>
                <p>Wilson was and still is the only dedicated NAGPRA worker at the Quapaw Nation. She said she tried to
                    get in touch with the Glenn Black Lab a couple times over the years, but personnel kept changing.

                <p>There was no dedicated NAGPRA employee or office at IU until August 2013. That’s when Jayne-Leigh was
                    hired, and shortly afterward, she and April Sievert, then-director of the Glenn Black Lab, met with
                    Wilson in-person, finally following up on the original letter from decades earlier.</p>
                <p>When she first started, Jayne-Leigh said she also sent letters in the mail, but didn’t hear back from
                    most Tribal representatives, who often deal with constant communication from many institutions. So
                    in 2014, she and April Sievert, then-director of the Glenn Black Lab, flew to Oklahoma and visited
                    Wilson, along with representatives from 13 other Tribal nations, in person.</p>
                <p>“We talked to 14 tribes in five days, and that was the start,” Jayne-Leigh said. “That goes a long
                    ways. Think of any friendship or relationship that you have — you have to put the time and effort
                    into it.”</p>

                </div>
                <p>The physical distance between IU and most of the Tribes involved in NAGPRA consultation is a result
                    of violent forced migrations West in the mid-1800s. This geography makes complying with NAGPRA in
                    the Midwest even more difficult, as consultations typically require flights, and people must decide
                    whether to rebury Native American remains in Indiana, or where the Tribe was forced to relocate.</p>
                <p>In 2018, representatives from at least 15 Tribal Nations, including Wilson, met in Bloomington to
                    consult with Jayne-Leigh and move forward with the repatriation of hundreds of Native American
                    remains that had been excavated from Angel Mounds. IU had received an $85,000 grant from the
                    National NAGPRA office the previous year, which helped fund the consultation, including paying for
                    the flights and hotels of Tribal representatives.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh said consultation meetings involve her asking the Tribal representatives where they want
                    to start.</p>
                <p>“I had put a map of Indiana up on the board and I said, ‘Do you want me to start with Southern
                    Indiana, Northern Indiana, along the Illinois-Ohio borders… I didn't want to make the decision,”
                    Thomas said. “And they said, ‘What's the largest collection you have?’ So that's what we did.”</p>
                <p>In spring 2021, the day after the spring equinox, Wilson and other Tribal representatives returned to
                    Indiana for the repatriation ceremony of the human remains from Angel Mounds, when more than 700
                    individuals were reburied.</p>
                <p>“Each one is different, and the reburial in that one was very spiritual and it was very emotional,”
                    Wilson said. “It really turned out very, very nice, and it was very appropriate for spring and new
                    birth, and new ideas and new friends, and actually just a new viewpoint to start all over again.”
                </p>
                <p>Since IU founded its NAGPRA office, its staff have completed about a dozen separate repatriation
                    projects, reburying more than 1,000 of its 5,800-plus individual human remains, based on public
                    data.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh said while NAGPRA work takes time to do properly, she hopes IU’s entire collection will
                    be repatriated well before she retires.</p>
                <p>Richard Wilk, the former department chair who raised concerns about IU’s potential non-compliance
                    with NAGPRA, said he was very happy when IU established its NAGPRA Office, and has been impressed
                    with the progress in the decade since.</p>
                <p>“It was much delayed. But when the university finally woke up, they really woke up,” Wilk said.</p>

                <p>NAGPRA has received more attention recently after ProPublica published an investigation into public
                    repatriation data in early January, which called out IU in particular for the large size of its
                    collection of human remains. But Jayne-Leigh, Pyburn and Wilson expressed concerns about the framing
                    of this story, which they said might put unhelpful pressure on both Tribes and institutions to speed
                    up the repatriation process.</p>
                <p>“The tribes are short staffed and museums are short staffed. We do the best we can with what we've
                    got,” Wilson said. “The finger pointing isn't going to do any good. Making unrealistic timelines
                    isn't going to do any good.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh Thomas said she has heard different reactions to the ProPublica investigation from the
                    Tribal representatives she works with.</p>
                <p>A lot of folks I’ve worked with are really against the ProPublica piece, but I know there's other
                    Tribal members that love it, because it's calling out institutions that aren't doing anything,”
                    Jayne-Leigh said. “You really get a mixed reaction with this type of reporting.”</p>
                <p>Wilson expressed concern that new proposed NAGPRA regulations could add harsh deadlines that would
                    make her job more difficult. In her opinion, the true barrier to more efficient repatriation is the
                    lack of federal funding for the national NAGPRA office and the scarcity and specificity of available
                    NAGPRA grants, she said.</p>
                <p>Wilson said the grants must be project-specific, meaning she could apply for a grant to cover the
                    costs of one specific repatriation but could not ask for money to guarantee funding for her
                    one-person department. She said money available to help Tribes create and maintain NAGPRA
                    departments would go a lot further.</p>
                <p>More funding from national NAGPRA would also help in other ways, she said. For example, disputes
                    between institutions and Tribes must be processed by national NAGPRA before any fines or other legal
                    action can proceed, but the office is typically very backed up. Also, while the office hired its
                    first investigator at the end of January to look into non-compliance at museums and universities,
                    Wilson said one investigator is far from sufficient to tackle such a large undertaking.</p>
                <p>National NAGPRA declined via email to be interviewed for this story, replying, “We don’t have time
                    for an interview right now.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh and professor Anne Pyburn also took issue with the ProPublica piece, largely because it
                    targeted institutions with the largest reported collections, which they said is not a fair criticism
                    to pin on NAGPRA workers today.</p>
                <p>“Having large numbers in your dataset doesn't mean you're out of compliance, and it doesn't mean
                    you're not doing good work,” Jayne-Leigh said. “You can have exceptionally small collections and be
                    anti-NAGPRA and refuse to work with communities.”</p>
                <p>Instead, she said the size of collections reflects on the practices of institutions decades and even
                    centuries ago.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh also noted that NAGPRA stories are often kept personal and private, because they involve
                    personal grief, like all funerals. NAGPRA coordinators are also careful to avoid disclosing the
                    location of reburial grounds in most cases to deter looters. For these reasons, she explained that
                    IU’s NAGPRA department often doesn’t publicize its progress, and the public typically does not know
                    about the complexity of ongoing projects within the department.</p>
                <p>“That's confidential, sensitive information, and when students or faculty or members of the public
                    don't have that information, they assume that things are being kept from them, and that may be true,
                    but for a good reason,” Jayne-Leigh said. “It's not appropriate for us, every time we do a
                    repatriation to write an article about it.”</p>
                <p>But, Jayne-Leigh said the reporting has been beneficial in calling out noncompliant institutions.</p>
                <p>“The silver lining is that for institutions that were not doing anything, hopefully it will get their
                    administrators to realize that they need to be doing better, and they will start to fund offices,”
                    she said.</p>
                <p>Wilson said in light of increased scrutiny on NAGPRA processes, she fears national NAGPRA might
                    introduce changes to the law and add deadlines that could further strain Tribes and museums that
                    already lack proper funding for NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>“Trying to expedite this process could turn very easily into kind of a garage sale mentality, of
                    saying, ‘Well, we just have to get them out of our museum, we'll just give them to the first Tribe
                    that shows interest,’ and that's not good,” Wilson said. “That's not going to help anybody. I don't
                    think that was the intent of NAGPRA.”</p>
                <p>For Wilson, NAGPRA work is a way to move on from the wrongdoings of the past and forge a new future.
                </p>
                <p>“Especially Tribes who have been removed from their homelands and been decimated by disease, it gives
                    us an opportunity to rediscover our past,” Wilson said. “It actually can be a spiritual journey and
                    enrich the Tribe in many different ways, if you do it right.”</p>

                    <h4>About this story</h4>
                    <p>The IDS spent more than three months researching NAGPRA at IU, conducting extensive
                        interviews
                        and
