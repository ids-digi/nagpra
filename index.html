            <div class="story">
                <p>“I was extremely disturbed by it,” Wesley said. “Something that people outside of a Native community
                    do not understand is that we're aware of our ancestors and their presence. My office got to the
                    point where I couldn't concentrate or focus, that I had to move out.”</p>
                <p>Wesley asked the anthropology department chair to move his office to a different building, and his
                    request was quickly fulfilled. But he still didn’t feel comfortable teaching at IU, where according
                    to interviews with Wesley and other past faculty, the majority of the anthropology department didn’t
                    see Indigenous perspectives as legitimate. Instead they adhered to “old school” teachings of the
                    field which cast Native American people as objects of scientific study rather than people with human
                    rights.</p>
                <p>In 1990, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act mandated that federally funded
                    institutions, including IU, start working to return their collections of Native American human
                    remains to Tribes through a process called repatriation, which typically ends in reburial. But none
                    of the human remains at IU were repatriated until 24 years after this law passed, and eight years
                    after Wesley had left the university.</p>
                <p>Slow responses to NAGPRA were not unusual, especially in the early years, when there was little
                    guidance on best practices for both institutions and Tribal Nations. 15 years after the law passed,
                    only about 40% of institutions had reported completing at least one repatriation, according to
                    public data.</p>
                <p>But in interviews with the Indiana Daily Student, current and former faculty alleged that IU avoided
                    complying with NAGPRA in good faith for years. Administrators pushed the immense and sensitive task
                    of starting the repatriation process onto anthropology faculty members who had full-time research
                    and teaching responsibilities and didn’t sign up for NAGPRA work. IU’s first inventory of its
                    remains classified the vast majority as “culturally unaffiliated,” leaning on a loophole in the law
                    which allowed institutions to avoid repatriation and continue research. Despite pushback from
                    faculty as early as 2000, IU didn’t provide funding for NAGPRA work until 2013 — three years after
                    the law was updated to close the “culturally unaffiliated” loophole.</p>
                <p>In that year, IU hired Jayne-Leigh Thomas (not related to Wesley), who still serves as the director
                    of the IU NAGPRA Office. In the 10 years since, Jayne-Leigh has greatly improved the university’s
                    reputation for NAGPRA compliance, building up a staff of five other full-time employees, forming
                    meaningful relationships with Tribal representatives, completing multiple large repatriations and
                    helping other universities build up similar programs.</p>
                <p>The story of NAGPRA at IU, which has garnered media attention after a January ProPublica
                    investigation, is one of great complexity. Faced with the problematic legacy of how IU acquired so
                    many human remains in the first place, IU employees and Tribal members agree the process of NAGPRA
                    today can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But it can help everyone involved move forward.
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Wesley Thomas said when he worked at IU in the early 2000s, NAGPRA was well-understood by everyone in
                    the anthropology department, faculty and graduate students, as it was a core concept taught in
                    classes. But he described it as a “hush” topic among faculty, along with other Indigenous issues.
                </p>
                <p>Wesley is a member of the Navajo Nation, and he was the only Native American faculty member in the
                    department. During his time as an assistant professor at IU from 2000 to 2006, he recalled other
                    faculty often changing the subject away from Indigenous topics as soon as he walked in the room.</p>
                <p>“If I start asking questions, that would upset the whole department and the university,” said Wesley,
                    who is also the founding director of the IU First Nations Culture Center.</p>
                <p>He said the culture of the department contributed to his decision to leave IU and return to the
                    Navajo Nation in 2006.</p>
                <p>“I felt extremely awkward, uncomfortable, unpleasant, that I shouldn't be there,” Wesley said. “I
                    think it was probably one of the reasons why I decided to leave. I knew it was not a place where
                    Indigenous people should be there as faculty members, because the university was not ready for it.”

            <div class="story">
                <p>Not every faculty member turned a blind eye to NAGPRA. The same year Wesley started at IU, Richard
                    Wilk became the department chair of the anthropology department, and said he was concerned about
                    what he described as IU’s noncompliance with the spirit of the law.</p>
                <p>In 1990, NAGPRA set a 1995 deadline for institutions to compile an inventory of all the human remains
                    in their possession. The inventory was necessary for institutions to determine how many human
                    remains they had and figure out which remains were associated with which Tribal nations based on
                    evidence — an important step for making repatriation work possible.</p>
                <p>Based on the original law, institutions — not Tribes — were the ones with the final say on whether
                    human remains were associated, or “culturally affiliated,” with Tribal Nations. Because of this,
                    some institutions leaned on a loophole which allowed them to mark remains as “culturally
                    unaffiliated” even if there was evidence otherwise, basically absolving them of the need to stop
                    research and work on repatriation.</p>
                <p>In IU’s original inventories, from both the Department of Anthropology and the Glenn Black Laboratory
                    of Archaeology, nearly all of the combined 5,800 reported human remains were marked culturally
                    unaffiliated. These ancestral remains continued to be researched for decades after the inventory was
                    submitted, according to xx.</p>
                <p>“You could basically get away with saying that everything's unaffiliated and we don't have to do
                    anything about it, especially when you think about how much it would cost and the time and the
                    effort required,” Wilk said. “Nobody really wanted to open up that can of worms.”</p>
                <p>Wilk said he raised concerns about the quality of the anthropology department’s inventory with the
                    dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the time, Kumble Subbaswamy, about IU’s potential
                    noncompliance with NAGPRA.</p>
                <p>“I felt we might be in compliance with the letter of the law,” Wilk said. “I didn't think we were
                    compliant with the spirit of the law.”</p>
                <p>Wilk said Subbaswamy dismissed his concerns, citing financial constraints.</p>
                <p>Wilk also wrote letters to and called the National NAGPRA office, hoping an official notice of
                    noncompliance would push IU administrators to act. But the office was busy, and didn’t have the
                    resources to investigate the truthfulness of IU’s reported inventory. As long as the university
                    continued to claim that the majority of its collection was culturally unaffiliated, it was
                    technically following the letter of the original law.</p>
                <p>Wilk also reached out to the dean of the law school, seeking clarification on the details of NAGPRA
                    to confirm IU wasn’t in legal trouble. But he didn’t hear back from them either.</p>
                <p>“I think rather than active opposition, what we got was lack of movement,” Wilk said. “There's a
                    difference between actively opposing something and just not dealing with it. And I think that's what
                    we were doing for a long time, was just not dealing with it.”</p>
                <p>Part of the reason no one wanted to deal with it goes back to the culture of the department. Most of
                    the faculty at the time had come up in a time when Native American remains were considered valuable
                    objects of scientific study, not a human rights issue, Wilk said.</p>
                <p>“Some of the older archeologists and the bio-anthropologists felt that NAGPRA was not a good thing
                    for their science,” Wilk said. “They didn't like having the bones taken away by Tribes who just
                    wanted to bury what they considered to be extremely valuable data that they had been wanting to
                    study and keep studying.”</p>
                <p>Indigenous issues have been addressed in the field of anthropology only recently, said Anne Pyburn,
                    IU Provost Professor of Anthropology who is also married to Wilk.</p>

                <p>“Anthropology has undergone a very serious series of changes in its direction and in its commitment
                    over the last couple of decades, and as a result, the standards of the discipline are quite
                    different from what they were when I was in graduate school in the ‘80s,” Pyburn said.</p>
                <p>The problematic past of anthropology is clear from the story of how IU acquired so many human
                    remains.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>For most of the history of anthropology, Native Americans have been viewed as objects of scientific
                    study rather than people. This worldview was baked into IU’s anthropology department from the start,
                    and led to the accumulation of more than 5,800 Native human remains, one of the largest reported
                    collections of a federally funded institution in the country.</p>
                <p>Eli Lilly, the grandson of the founder of Eli Lilly and Company, is a key character in the story of
                    how IU ended up with so many human remains. Lilly became fascinated with archaeology when he was 45,
                    and spent decades largely funding the discipline statewide, according to his biography. He funded
                    both the IU Department of Anthropology in 1947 and the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology in
                    1965.</p>
                <p>Hoping to build scholarship on what Indiana was like thousands of years ago, Lilly made use of his
                    extensive financial resources to sponsor archaeologists and graduate students who excavated and
                    acquired many of the Native American remains in IU’s collection today.</p>
                <p>Starting in 1931, he sponsored Glenn A. Black, an unemployed cost estimator with an interest in
                    archaeology, covering his field expenses and arranging for him to study at the Ohio State Museum.
                    Black and Lilly would become close friends, exchanging lengthy letters about Indiana prehistory for
                    decades and comparing their relationship to that of a father and son.</p>
                <p>Around the same time, Lilly began a decades-long obsession with the Walam Olum, a set of birch bark
                    scrolls supposedly found and transcribed by natural scientist Constantine Rafinesque from the
                    Lenape, or Delaware, language into English in 1833, which most historians now agree was probably
                    forged.</p>
                <p>Lilly sponsored several more anthropologists as part of a plan to prove the document’s validity by
                    assembling a multidisciplinary research team. In the mid-1930s, Lilly provided fellowships to
                    linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Voegelin, archaeologist James B. Griffin, and physical
                    anthropologist Georg K. Neumann, who specialized in the study of skeletal remains.</p>
                <p>Black, Voegelin, Griffin, Neumann and a few others became known as the “Indiana group,” according to
                    Lilly’s biography. Lilly planned to combine research from the work of his Indiana group into a
                    definitive manuscript, which could prove the story of the Walam Olum.</p>
                <p>Lilly’s interest in the Walam Olum was rooted in his desire to link the Lenape, or Delaware, Tribe
                    with ancient settlements in Indiana, where large burial mounds like the ones at the Angel Mounds
                    site in Vanderburgh County were built. As an enthusiast about the history of Indiana, this
                    hypothesis greatly appealed to him.</p>
                <p>Since it first surfaced in 1833, the Walam Olum has repeatedly been used by researchers to fit Native
                    narratives into their personal beliefs or political agendas.</p>
                <p>According to historian Andrew Newman, Rafinesque, the scientist who claimed to have found the
                    original copy, was sympathetic to the Native American cause in the years following the brutal Indian
                    Removal Act of 1830, which forced at least 18 Tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi River,
                    including most of the Tribal Nations in Indiana. Newman pointed out that Rafinesque likely had a
                    political motivation to publish the Walam Olum, because it claimed the Lenape people migrated from
                    the Old World, and he hoped to generate sympathy for Native people by linking their genetic and
                    cultural heritage to Europeans. This could also explain why he claimed the Walam Olum was structured
                    just like a book, because books and literacy are often seen as a requirement for a society to be
                    considered “advanced” by Western standards.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Walam Olum has also been used to provide evidence for the existence of a
                    fabled “race” of Mound Builders, a myth from the early 20th century, said Kelsey Grimm, librarian
                    and archivist at the IU Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The myth posited that the ancient
                    people who built burial mounds had to have been more advanced, and more directly related to
                    Europeans, than the Native Tribes that still live in America.</p>
                <p>“That is false. That's a fallacy, that was a racist myth,” Grimm said.</p>
                <p>Regardless of Rafinesque’s motivations, his approach — and Lilly’s — delegitimized Indigenous
                    perspectives, discounting Lenape oral history and implying that Native American culture would only
                    be valid if it fit into traditional Western ideas of advanced civilizations.</p>
                <p>As early as 1932, Lilly was discouraged by contemporaries from pursuing Walam Olum research. In one
                    letter quoted in Lilly’s biography, anthropologist Carl Guthe wrote that “the Walam Olum thesis is a
                    rather frail reed on which to lean in archaeological work.” But Lilly and his Indiana group
                    continued work on the thesis for 20 years, continuing to come back to the project as they also
                    pursued other research into Indiana’s prehistory.</p>
                <p>In 1938, Lilly provided $68,000 (more than $1.4 million today) to help the Indiana Historical Society
                    purchase the Angel Mounds site in Vanderburgh County, and Black began to excavate. Materials from
                    Angel Mounds form the largest portion of IU’s archaeological collection today, comprising more than
                    2.5 million artifacts, including pot sherds, ceramics, stones, animal bones and shells. Black and
                    others also excavated hundreds of human remains there.</p>
                <p>The earliest excavations at Angel Mounds were aided by free labor from the Works Progress
                    Administration, a New Deal agency founded to combat the Great Depression by providing jobs for
                    struggling Americans. The WPA paid for more than 200 unskilled laborers to excavate Angel Mounds
                    under the guidance of Lilly and Black.</p>
                <p>“Archaeology was a good Depression-era activity, because it didn't create consumables that people had
                    to buy,” Grimm said. “It creates jobs without people having to buy a product.”</p>
                <p>Aside from Angel Mounds, Lilly continued to fund the research of his Indiana group. This research
                    brought Native American remains from dozens of U.S. states to IU through donations from other
                    museums, universities or private donors, which was one of the main ways anthropologists acquired
                    research materials through the 20th century other than doing their own excavations, like at Angel
                    Mounds.</p>
                <p>[map]</p>
                <p>Neumann, the physical anthropologist, had a particular interest in skulls, and studied at least
                    10,000 of them during his career. Sometimes he would visit other museums to examine their materials,
                    but often he would receive donated skeletal remains that would then remain at IU permanently.</p>
                <p>Neumann’s research fell into the category of racial classification, the pseudoscientific theory that
                    was often used in hopes of proving a genetic difference between human races by studying people’s
                    physical characteristics, a concept used to scientifically reinforce racial hierarchies. Neumann
                    practiced phrenology, the study of the shape and measurements of skulls, which is now considered
                    pseudoscience. Neumann was one of the leading physical anthropologists studying Native American
                    remains, and he sought to classify human remains from different Tribal groups into racial
                    categories, according to an analysis of his work by IU professor Della Collins Cook, who was hired
                    as his replacement in the 1970s.</p>
                <p>Neumann’s career built on the work of scientists like Samuel Morton, a phrenologist who classified
                    humans into five different races and who associated skull size with intelligence and racial
                    superiority, and whose work was used to justify chattel slavery.</p>
                <p>Partnering with Indiana University was a logical next step for Lilly, who needed an institution to
                    house artifacts and continue to produce research as part of his long-term goal of ensuring a future
                    for anthropology work in Indiana. By mid-1947, Lilly had worked with then-Chancellor Herman B Wells
                    to establish the IU Department of Archaeology, instating Black, Voegelin and Neumann as the core
                    faculty.</p>
                <p>A few years later, Lilly finally achieved his goal of publishing a manuscript on the Walam Olum,
                    titled “Walam Olum or Red Score: The Migration Legend of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians.” The
                    book received mixed reviews, as anthropologists recognized the impressive scope of the project, but
                    also pointed out the limitations of relying on the Walam Olum as a primary document.</p>
                <p>“The scholarly essays are best read as exercises in stating one's contradictory conclusions in a
                    manner designed to give as little offense as possible to one's sponsor,” Cook wrote of the
                    manuscript.</p>
                <p>Black continued to excavate Angel Mounds, where he lived for most of his life, until his sudden death
                    in 1964. At that time, Lilly funded the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology at IU, both to
                    honor his friend and to provide a place to store and facilitate the research of the millions of
                    artifacts and hundreds of human remains that could no longer be stored at Angel Mounds.</p>
                <p>The methods used to acquire Native American remains for study and the nature of that resulting
                    research is seen as extremely offensive by most Native American Tribes today.</p>
                <p>Carrie Wilson, NAGPRA Director at the Quapaw Nation, said she can’t understand why past scientists
                    felt the need to excavate human remains.</p>
                <p>“I call it the Cracker Jack mentality,” Wilson said. “Everybody likes to just dump their stuff out
                    and go find the Cracker Jack prize, you know, whether it's Tutankhamen or the viking mound or
                    whatever, people just have fun digging in the dirt. It’s just crazy.”</p>
                <p>But Wilson said she doesn’t dwell on offensive past research while working on NAGPRA. Instead, she
                    focuses on moving forward.</p>
                <p>“As far as trying to understand the logic behind it and all that kind of stuff, I can't even begin to
                    go there,” she said. “I don't know. But anyway, there's lots of human remains out there, and they
                    still have to be reburied.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>In the early 1990s, Wilson, received a letter from the Glenn Black Lab at IU notifying her that IU
                    had human remains likely affiliated with the Quapaw. Because of a combination of factors, those
                    remains wouldn’t be repatriated until 2021.</p>
                <p>“There wasn't any email in 1995,” said Jayne-Leigh Thomas, director of the IU NAGPRA Office. “What
                    was happening across the country is that the tribes were being inundated by stacks and stacks and
                    stacks of those written letters, and not necessarily having an office that was dedicated to handling
                    all that.”</p>
                <p>Wilson was and still is the only dedicated NAGPRA worker at the Quapaw Nation. She said she tried to
                    get in touch with the Glenn Black Lab a couple times over the years, but the director position kept
                    changing hands.</p>
                <p>There was no dedicated NAGPRA employee or office at IU until the 2012-13 school year, when the office
                    first appeared on a university budget. That’s the year Jayne-Leigh was hired, and shortly afterward,
                    she got in touch with Wilson, finally closing the loop.</p>
                <p>When she first started, Jayne-Leigh said she also sent letters in the mail, but didn’t hear back from
                    most Tribal representatives, who often deal with constant communication from many institutions. So
                    she and a colleague flew to Oklahoma and visited Wilson, along with representatives from 13 other
                    Tribal nations, in person.</p>
                <p>“We talked to 14 tribes in five days, and that was the start,” Jayne-Leigh said. “That goes a long
                    ways. Think of any friendship or relationship that you have — you have to put the time and effort
                    into it.”</p>
                <p>The physical distance between IU and most of the Tribes involved in NAGPRA consultation is a result
                    of violent forced migrations West in the mid-1800s. This geography makes complying with NAGPRA in
                    the Midwest even more difficult, as consultations typically require flights, and people must decide
                    whether to rebury Native American remains in Indiana, or where the Tribe was forced to relocate. It
                    can also make it harder to determine cultural affiliation, and some consultations involve upwards of
                    a dozen Tribes.</p>
                <p>In 2018, representatives from at least 15 Tribal Nations, including Wilson, met in Bloomington to
                    consult with Jayne-Leigh and move forward with the repatriation of hundreds of Native American
                    remains that had been excavated from Angel Mounds. IU had received an $85,000 grant from National
                    NAGPRA the previous year, which helped fund the consultation, including paying for the flights and
                    hotels of Tribal representatives.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh said consultation meetings involve her asking the Tribal representatives where they want
                    to start.</p>
                <p>“I had put a map of Indiana up on the board and I said, ‘Do you want me to start with Southern
                    Indiana, Northern Indiana, along the Illinois-Ohio borders… I didn't want to make the decision,”
                    Thomas said. “And they said, ‘What's the largest collection you have?’ So that's what we did.”</p>
                <p>In spring 2021, Wilson and other Tribal representatives returned to Indiana for the repatriation
                    ceremony of the human remains from Angel Mounds, when more than 700 individuals were reburied.</p>
                <p>“Each one is different, and the reburial in that one was very spiritual and it was very emotional,”
                    Wilson said. “We're people. This is an organic experience, and so it's not just the approach of
                    paper to pen and getting it all done in a very academic kind of sterile way.”</p>
                <p>Since IU founded its NAGPRA office, its staff have completed six separate repatriation projects,
                    reburying approximately 17% of its more than 5,800 individual human remains.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh said while NAGPRA work takes time to do properly, she hopes IU’s entire collection will
                    be repatriated well before she retires.</p>
                <p>Richard Wilk, the former department chair who raised concerns about IU’s potential non-compliance
                    with NAGPRA, said he was very happy to see IU establish a NAGPRA Office, and has been impressed with
                    the office’s progress in the decade since.</p>
                <p>“It was much delayed. But when the university finally woke up, they really woke up,” Wilk said.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>NAGPRA has received more attention recently after ProPublica published an investigation into public
                    repatriation data in early January, which called out IU in particular for the large size of its
                    collection of human remains. But Wilson and multiple IU faculty expressed concerns about the effect
                    of this investigation, which they say puts unhelpful pressure on both Tribes and institutions to
                    speed up the repatriation process.</p>
                <p>“The tribes are short staffed and museums are short staffed. We do the best we can with what we've
                    got,” Wilson said. “The finger pointing isn't going to do any good. Making unrealistic timelines
                    isn't going to do any good — all it's going to do is make it worse.”</p>
                <p>Wilson expressed fear that proposed solutions resulting from such news coverage could add harsh
                    deadlines that would make her job more difficult. In her opinion, the true barrier to more efficient
                    repatriation is the lack of federal funding for the national NAGPRA office and the scarcity and
                    specificity of available NAGPRA grants.</p>
                <p>“The NAGPRA grants are very cumbersome, and they're very competitive,” Wilson said.</p>
                <p>She said the grants must be project-specific, meaning Wilson could apply for a grant to cover the
                    costs of one specific repatriation but could not ask for money to guarantee funding for her
                    one-person department. She said money available to help Tribes create and maintain NAGPRA
                    departments would go a lot further.</p>
                <p>More funding from national NAGPRA would also help in other ways, she said. For example, disputes
                    between institutions and Tribes must be processed by national NAGPRA before any fines or other legal
                    action can proceed, but the office is typically very backed up. Also, while the office hired its
                    first investigator at the end of January to look into non-compliance at museums and universities,
                    Wilson said one investigator is far from sufficient to tackle such a large undertaking.</p>
                <p>National NAGPRA declined via email to be interviewed for this story, replying, “We don’t have time
                    for an interview right now.”</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh and professor Anne Pyburn also took issue with the ProPublica piece, largely because it
                    targeted institutions with the largest reported collections, which they said is not a fair criticism
                    to pin on present-day NAGPRA workers.</p>
                <p>“Having large numbers in your dataset doesn't mean you're out of compliance, and it doesn't mean
                    you're not doing good work,” Jayne-Leigh said. “You can have exceptionally small collections and be
                    anti-NAGPRA and refuse to work with communities.”</p>
                <p>Instead, she said the size of collections reflects on the practices of institutions decades and even
                    centuries ago.</p>
                <p>Jayne-Leigh also noted that NAGPRA stories are often kept personal and private, because they involve
                    personal grief and spiritual ceremonies. NAGPRA coordinators are also careful to avoid disclosing
                    the location of reburial grounds in most cases to deter looters. For these reasons, she explained
                    that IU’s NAGPRA department often doesn’t publicize its progress, and the public typically does not
                    know about the complexity of ongoing projects within the department.</p>
                <p>“That's confidential, sensitive information, and when students or faculty or members of the public
                    don't have that information, they assume that things are being kept from them, and that may be true,
                    but for a good reason,” Thomas said. “It's not appropriate for us, every time we do a repatriation
                    to write an article about it.”</p>
                <p>Wilson said in light of increased scrutiny on NAGPRA processes, she fears national NAGPRA might
                    introduce changes to the law and add deadlines that could further strain Tribes and museums that
                    already lack proper funding for NAGPRA work.</p>
                <p>“Trying to expedite this process could turn very easily into kind of a garage sale mentality, of
                    saying, ‘Well, we just have to get them out of our museum, we'll just give them to the first Tribe
                    that shows interest,’ and that's not good,” Wilson said. “That's not going to help anybody. I don't
                    think that was the intent of NAGPRA.”</p>
                <p>For Wilson, NAGPRA work is a way to move on from the wrongdoings of the past and forge a new future.
                </p>
                <p>“Certainly there's been so many things done wrong to the American Indian,” Wilson said. “If there's
                    anything to say for the American Indian, it's that we're still here. We're vibrant. We're survivors.
                    You can recognize the past but you don't have to live the past. Acknowledge it and go on.”</p>
                <p>About this story</p>
                <p>The IDS spent more than three months researching NAGPRA at IU, conducting extensive interviews and
                    reading historical documents. Reporting on the history of anthropology at IU referred to chapter 6
                    of Eli Lilly, a Life, a 1989 biography written by James Madison; chapter 2 of Bioarchaeology: the
                    contextual analysis of human remains by Della Collins Cook; primary documents reviewed at the IU
                    Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, including letters to and from Lilly, Black, Voegelin and
                    Neumann; and interviews with IUMAA staff.</p>
